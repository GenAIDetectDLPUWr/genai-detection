## Overview
This is GenAI Image Classification project built with Kedro library.

We are trying to discriminate between images that are taken in the real world or created by hand and images generated using generative models like DALLE, Midjourney, or Stable Diffusion.

From our world:

## Installation
Docker is required to run the project. To build the Docker image:
Clone the repo and run the following command:

```
docker build -f enivronments/Dockerfile.kedro -t deep-learning-project .
```
or just run:
```
docker pull kabanosk/deep-learning-project
```

There are other Dockerfiles in the `environments` directory that can be used to build images for different purposes.
* `Dockerfile.kedro` - image with entrypoint `kedro run`
* `Dockerfile.api` - image with api and gradio dependecy group
* `Dockerfile.test` - image with test dependecy group
* `Dockerfile` - image with dev dependecy group


## Usage
To run the training and evaluation pipeline, you need to run the Docker container with the following command

```
# training
docker run -v ./data:/data --env WANDB_API_KEY=<WANDB_API_KEY> deep-learning-project --pipeline training

# evaluation
docker run -v ./data:/data --env WANDB_API_KEY=<WANDB_API_KEY> deep-learning-project --pipeline evaluation
```

### Kedro 

If you want to run Kedro manualy, you can run:

```
docker run -v ./data:/data --expose 4242 -it --entrypoint /bin/bash deep-learning-project
```

Then you can run Kedro commands:

```
kedro run
```

To visualize project run: 

```
poetry install --with dev
kedro viz run --port 4242
```

Then you can open browser and go to `http://localhost:4242/`
